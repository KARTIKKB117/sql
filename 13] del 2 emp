-- -- Q13: Write a PL/SQL Trigger not to delete more than 2 employees at a time

-- CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_delete
-- BEFORE DELETE ON employee
-- DECLARE
--     emp_count NUMBER;
-- BEGIN
--     -- Count number of rows deleted
--     SELECT COUNT(*) INTO emp_count FROM employee
--     WHERE empid IN (SELECT empid FROM deleted_rows); -- Note: 'deleted_rows' is non-standard and should be a temporary or external mechanism for a 'BEFORE' statement trigger to count rows being acted upon.
--                                                      -- A standard approach for 'BEFORE DELETE' statement triggers to count rows is typically not possible without a view or other mechanism.
    
--     -- If more than 2 rows are being deleted, raise an error
--     IF emp_count > 2 THEN
--         RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'You cannot delete more than 2 employees at a time.');
--     END IF;
-- END;
-- /
--  delete from employee where empid in (102,105);
-- commit;
-- -- delete from sales  where empid in (102,105);
-- -- commit;



--  select * from employee;
